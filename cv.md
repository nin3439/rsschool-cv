## *Summary*
Hello! Thank you for visiting my page.

I’m on maternity leave now, my kid’s already in kindergarten and I have a lot of free time. I **can** and I **WANT** to change my specialty. Before that I used to work as a pharmacist. I have extensive experience in communicating with customers and resolving different conflicts. Now I’m just starting to learn programming. Therefore, I need a mentor to help me improve the quality of my knowledge of Javascript and give me some great advice.

I learn quickly, I am patient and responsible. I like try and learn something new. I am ready to work hard to achieve my goals. I am polite, sociable and I like to help people.
